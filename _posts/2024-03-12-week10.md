## Today


* SVM
* PCA

## Announcement


* HW 5 due 3/16
* HW6/Final project posted
	* 	We will spend some time in class on Sunday to discuss them.
*  When you submit your HW6, ensure everything is **properly rendered** and all the code/results are **reproducible** (esp. from another computer).
*  Given the short time frame for grading the last HW, we **WON'T** accommodate any changes once submitted.
*  You **CAN** re-write/resubmit your previous HW. We will take a look. But it **WILL NOT** change your grade of that particular HW. However, we may consider it when giving the final grade for this class.
